RANKING FUNCTIONS :-
------------------
	-->TO ASSIGN THE RANKS TO EACH ROW WISE AND
	   GROUP OF THE ROW WISE
	-->WE CAN GIVE RANKINGS BASED ON THE ASCENDING
	   OR DECENDING ORDER PRIORITY
	-->THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF RANKING FUNCTIONS:-
		=>ROW_NUMBER()
		=>RANK()
		=>DENSE_RANK()
	-->THESE FUNCTIONS ARE DONE UNDER THE PARTION_CLAUSE
	   AND ORDER BY CLAUSE
	-->PARTITION CLAUSE IS USED ONLY IF THE RANKING IS 
	   GIVING BY GROUP OF ROWS
===========================================================
SYNTAX : -
----------
	RANKING FUCNTION() OVER (
		PARTITION BY <COLUMN NAME> 
		ORDER BY <COLUMN NAME> [ASC / DESC]
		)
	Here,
	PARTITION BY == > OPTIONAL (used on group of rows)
	ORDER BY == > MANDATORY CLAUSE.
EXAMPLE : -
---------
==>ROW_NUMBER() : -

	SELECT ENAME,SAL,ROW_NUMBER()
		OVER(
			ORDER BY SAL DESC 
		) AS RNK FROM EMPLOYEE1
	
	SELECT ENAME,SAL,ROW_NUMBER()
		OVER(
			PARTITION BY DEPTNO
			ORDER BY SAL DESC 
		) AS RNK FROM EMPLOYEE1

==>RANK() : -
	SELECT ENAME,SAL,RANK()
		OVER(
			ORDER BY SAL DESC 
		) AS RNK FROM EMPLOYEE1

	SELECT ENAME,SAL,RANK()
		OVER(
			PARTITION BY DEPTNO
			ORDER BY SAL DESC 
		) AS RNK FROM EMPLOYEE1


==>DENSE_RANK() : -
	SELECT ENAME,SAL,DENSE_RANK()
		OVER(
			PARTITION BY DEPTNO
			ORDER BY SAL DESC 
		) AS RNK FROM EMPLOYEE1
