TRANSACTIONAL CONTROL LANGUAGE : -
==============================
	-->ONE OF THE SUB LANGUAGE OF SQL

	-->TRANSACTION : -
	   -------------
		=>TO PERFORM SOME ACTION / OPERATION
			-->INSERT
			-->UPDATE
			-->DELETE
			-->THE ABOVE OPERATIONS ARE CONTROL ON THE TABLE DATA 
	-->TO CONTROL THE DATA OF THE TABLE PURPOSE : -
		=>BEGIN TRANSACTION (manddatory)
		=>COMMIT
		=>ROLLBACK
		=>SAVEPOINT
==>BY DEFAULT THE DML OPERATIONS (INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE) ARE AUTO COMMIT OPERATIONS
=>AUTO COMMIT : -
  -------------
	-->SYSTEM COMMIT THE DML OPERATION WHICH WAS PERFORMNED BY THE USER ON A
	TABLE AUTOMATICALLY.
	-->USER DOES NOT HAVE ANY CHANCE TO CHANGE THOSE OPERATIONS.
	-->THIS IS ALSO KNOWN AS IMPLICIT OPERATIONS(TRANSACTIONS)
-->WHEN USER CAN CONVERT FROM IMPLICIT TO EXPLICIT ,THE USER CAN COMMIT WHEN IT
   CAN BE IMLICIT AND WHEN IT CAN BE EXPLICIT


==>BEGIN TRANSACTION :-
----------------------
	TO START THE TRANSACTION
	SYNTAX : -

		BEGIN TRANSACTION
		<WRITE STATEMENTS>
		SAVE TRANSACTION <POINTER NAME>
		<WRITE STATEMENTS WHICH WE WANT TO STORE IN POINTER>
SAVE POINT :-
BEGIN TRANSACTION
DELETE FROM BRANCH WHERE BCODE = 1021
DELETE FROM BRANCH WHERE BCODE = 1022
SAVE TRANSACTION S1
DELETE FROM BRANCH WHERE BCODE = 1023

SELECT * FROM BRANCH

BEGIN TRANSACTION
ROLLBACK TRANSACTION S1

SELECT * FROM BRANCH

	










COMMIT AND ROLL BACK :-

--INSERT :-
BEGIN TRANSACTION

--UPDATE :-
BEGIN TRANSACTION
UPDATE BRANCH SET LOCATION = 'MUMBAI' WHERE BCODE = 1021
SELECT * FROM BRANCH
BEGIN TRANSACTION
ROLLBACK
SELECT * FROM BRANCH
	--COMMIT
