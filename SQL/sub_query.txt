SUB QUERIES / NESTED QUERIES :-
------------------------------
	-->A QUERY INSIDE ANOTHER QUERY IS CALLED SUB / NESTED QUERIES.
	-->SYNTAX :-
	----------
		SELCT * FROM <TN> WHERE <CONDITION>
		(SELECT * FROM....................
		(SELECT * FROM..................)))
	-->FIRST SELECT STATEMENT IS CALLED AS OUTER QUERY
	-->SELECT STATEMENTS INSIDE THE OUTER QUERY IS CALLED INNER QUERY.
	-->AS PER THE EXEUTION PROCESS OF SUB QUERY IT AGAIN CLASSIFIED 
	INTO TWO WAYS :-
		-->NON-CORELATED SUB QUERY:-
		--------------------------
			=>IN NON-CORELATED SUB QUERY FIRST INEER QUERY IS EXECUTED
			AND LATER OUTER QUERY WILL EXECUTE.
			=>OUTER QUERY IS ALWAYS DEPENDS ON RESULT OF INNER QUERY.

		-->CORELATED SUB QUERY:-
		------------------------
			=>IN CORELATED SUB QUERY FIRST OUTER QUERY IS EXECUTED
			ADN LATER INNER QUERY WILL EXECUTE
			=>INNER QUERY IS ALWASY DEPENDS ON RESULT OF OUTER QUERY


WORKING WITH A NON-CORELATED SUB QUERIES :-
-----------------------------------------
	-->FIRST INEER QUERY IS EXECUTED AND LATER OUTER QUERY WILL EXECUTE.
	-->TYPES OF NON-CORELATED SUB QUERY :-
	-------------------------------------
		=>SIMPLE / SINGLE ROW SUB QUERY
		=>MULTIPLE / MULTI ROW SUB QUERY

	=>SIMPLE / SINGLE ROW SUB QUERY:-	
	-------------------------------
		WHEN A SUB QUERY RETURNS A SINGLE VALUE IS CALLED SIMPLE /
		SINGLE ROW SUB QUERY
	EXAMPLE :-
	--------
		=>TO GET EMPLOYEEE DETAILS FROM THE TABLE WHO ARE GETTING THE
		FIRST HIGEST SALARY IN THE TABLE
		
		=>EXPLANATION : -
		---------------
			SUB QUERY = OUTER + INNER

			INNER QUERY : -
				SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMPLOYEE1
			OUTER QUERY :-
				SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE1 WHERE SAL = <INNER QUERY>
		=>SOLUTION :-
		------------
			SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE1 WHERE SAL = (SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMPLOYEE1)

	=>MULTIPLE / MULTI ROW SUB QUERY :-
	---------------------------------
		WHEN A SUB QUERY RETURNS A MULTI VALUE IS CALLED SIMPLE /
		SINGLE ROW SUB QUERY
		WE CAN USE OPERATIR "IN"
		
	EXAMPLE :-
	---------
		=>TO DISPLAY EMPLOYEEE DETAILS FROM THE TABLE WHSOE DEPARTMENT IS SAME AS DEPART OF 
		EMPLOYEE A OR B
		
		=>EXPLANATION :-
		--------------	
			SUB QUERY = OUTER IN INNER

			INNER QUERY : -
				SELECT DEPTNAME FROM EMPLOYEE1 WHERE ENAME = 'A' OR ENAME = 'B'
			OUTER QUERY :-
				SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE1 WHERE DEPTNAME IN (INNER QUERY)
		=>SOLUTION :-
		------------	
			SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE1 WHERE DEPTNAME IN 
			(SELCT DEPTNAME FROM EMPLOYEE1 WHERE ENAME = 'A' OR ENAME = 'B')	

					(or)

			SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE1 WHERE DEPTNAME IN 
			(SELCT DEPTNAME FROM EMPLOYEE1 WHERE ENAME IN ('A','B')
