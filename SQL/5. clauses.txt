CLAUSES : -
-----------
	-->TWO TYPES
		==>GROUP BY CLAUSE
		==>WHERE CLAUSE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
==>GROUP BY CLAUSE : -
	-->IT IS USED TO GROUPING THE SIMILAR DATA BASED ON THE COLUMNS

EXAMPLE : -
-----------
CREATE TABLE EMPLYDETAILS (ID INT,NAME VARCHAR(20),JOB VARCHAR(20))
INSERT EMPLYDETAILS VALUES (101,'A','CLERK') , (102,'B','MANAGER') , (103,'C','HR') , (104,'D','CLERK') , (105,'E','HR') , (106,'F','MANAGER'),
					(107,'G','CLERK') , (108,'H','PRESIDENT') , (109,'I','HR') , (110,'J','HR') , (111,'K','CLERK') , (112,'L','PRESIDENT')
ALTER TABLE EMPLYDETAILS ADD SALARY INT
ALTER TABLE EMPLYDETAILS ADD DEPT INT
SELECT * FROM EMPLYDETAILS
UPDATE EMPLYDETAILS SET SALARY = 10000 WHERE SALARY IS NULL AND JOB = 'CLERK'
UPDATE EMPLYDETAILS SET SALARY = 20000 WHERE SALARY IS NULL AND JOB = 'MANAGER'
UPDATE EMPLYDETAILS SET SALARY = 30000 WHERE SALARY IS NULL AND JOB = 'HR'
UPDATE EMPLYDETAILS SET SALARY = 50000 WHERE SALARY IS NULL AND JOB = 'PRESIDENT'

UPDATE EMPLYDETAILS SET DEPT = 10 WHERE DEPT IS NULL AND JOB = 'CLERK'
UPDATE EMPLYDETAILS SET DEPT = 20 WHERE DEPT IS NULL AND JOB = 'MANAGER'
UPDATE EMPLYDETAILS SET DEPT = 30 WHERE DEPT IS NULL AND JOB = 'HR'
UPDATE EMPLYDETAILS SET DEPT = 30 WHERE DEPT IS NULL AND JOB = 'PRESIDENT'
-->QUERY IS NUMBER OF EMPLOYESS WORKING IN PARTICULAR JOB(SINGLE COLUMN)
	SELECT JOB,COUNT(*) CNT FROM EMPLYDETAILS GROUP BY JOB

-->QUERY IS TO FIND THE TOTAL SALARY OF THE SPECIFIC JOBS(SINGLE COLUMN)
	SELECT JOB,SUM(SALARY) TOTAL FROM EMPLYDETAILS GROUP BY JOB

-->QUERY TO FIND MAX SALARY, MINIMUM SALARY, AVERAGE SAKARY OF THE JOBS(SINGLE COLUMN)
	SELECT JOB,MAX(SALARY) MAXSAL , MIN(SALARY) MINSAL , AVG(SALARY) AVGSAL FROM EMPLYDETAILS GROUP BY JOB

-->QUERY TO FIND THAT HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE WORKING IN EACH JOB ALONG WITH DEPT NUMBER(MULTIPLE COLUMN)
	SELECT JOB,COUNT(*) CNT,DEPT FROM EMPLYDETAILS GROUP BY JOB,DEPT

==>HAVING CLAUSE : --
	--TO FILTER THE RECORDS AFTER GROUPING THE DATA
	--HAVING CAN BE USED ALONG WITH GROUP BY CLAUSE

EXAMPLE : -
-----------
CREATE TABLE EMPLYDETAILS (ID INT,NAME VARCHAR(20),JOB VARCHAR(20))
INSERT EMPLYDETAILS VALUES (101,'A','CLERK') , (102,'B','MANAGER') , (103,'C','HR') , (104,'D','CLERK') , (105,'E','HR') , (106,'F','MANAGER'),
					(107,'G','CLERK') , (108,'H','PRESIDENT') , (109,'I','HR') , (110,'J','HR') , (111,'K','CLERK') , (112,'L','PRESIDENT')
ALTER TABLE EMPLYDETAILS ADD SALARY INT
ALTER TABLE EMPLYDETAILS ADD DEPT INT
SELECT * FROM EMPLYDETAILS
UPDATE EMPLYDETAILS SET SALARY = 10000 WHERE SALARY IS NULL AND JOB = 'CLERK'
UPDATE EMPLYDETAILS SET SALARY = 20000 WHERE SALARY IS NULL AND JOB = 'MANAGER'
UPDATE EMPLYDETAILS SET SALARY = 30000 WHERE SALARY IS NULL AND JOB = 'HR'
UPDATE EMPLYDETAILS SET SALARY = 50000 WHERE SALARY IS NULL AND JOB = 'PRESIDENT'

UPDATE EMPLYDETAILS SET DEPT = 10 WHERE DEPT IS NULL AND JOB = 'CLERK'
UPDATE EMPLYDETAILS SET DEPT = 20 WHERE DEPT IS NULL AND JOB = 'MANAGER'
UPDATE EMPLYDETAILS SET DEPT = 30 WHERE DEPT IS NULL AND JOB = 'HR'
UPDATE EMPLYDETAILS SET DEPT = 30 WHERE DEPT IS NULL AND JOB = 'PRESIDENT'

--QUERY TO FIND THE COUNT OF JOBS LESS THAN 4
	SELECT JOB,COUNT(*) CNT FROM EMPLYDETAILS GROUP BY JOB HAVING COUNT(*) < 4

--QUERY IS TO FIND THE TOTAL SALARY OF THE SPECIFIC JOBS HAVING LESS THAN 30000
	SELECT JOB,SUM(SALARY) TOTAL FROM EMPLYDETAILS GROUP BY JOB HAVING SUM(SALARY) > 40000


ROLLUP AND CUBE: -
----------------
	-->TO FIND SUB AND GRAND TOTAL OF GIVEN GROUP OF VALUES
	-->ROLLUP CLAUSES IF FINDING SUB AND GRAND TOTAL BASED ON SINGLE COLUMN
	-->CUDE CLAUSE IF FINDING SUB AND GRAND TOTAL BASED ON MULTIPLE COLUMNS
 	-->WE CAN NOT CHANGE THE NULL VALUE OF GRAND TOTAL
	-->THESE TWO CLAUSES CAN BE USED ALONG WITH GROUP BY.
	-->SYNTAX : -
	------------
		SELECT <COLUMN1>,<COLUMN2>,........FROM <TN>
		GROUP BY ROLLUP/CUBE(<COLUMN1>,<COLUMN2>,......);

EXAMPLE : -
----------
SELECT * FROM EMPLYDETAILS
--ROLLUP:-
	SELECT JOB,COUNT(*) CNT FROM EMPLYDETAILS GROUP BY ROLLUP(JOB)
--CUBE :-
	SELECT JOB,COUNT(*) CNT,DEPT FROM EMPLYDETAILS GROUP BY CUBE(JOB,DEPT)
