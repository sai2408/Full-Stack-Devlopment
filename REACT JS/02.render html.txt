RENDER IN HTML:
===============
=>React renders HTML to the web page by using a function called ReactDOM.render().

RENDER FUNCTION:
-------------------------------
=>The ReactDOM.render() function takes two arguments, HTML code and an HTML element.
=>The purpose of the function is to display the specified HTML code inside the specified HTML element.
=>There is another folder in the root directory of your React project, named "public". In this folder, there is an index.html file.
EXAMPLE:

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

const myelement = (
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>John</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Elsa</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
);

ReactDOM.render(myelement, document.getElementById('root'));

ROOT NODE:
-------------------
=>The root node is the HTML element where you want to display the result.
=>It is like a container for content managed by React.
=>It does NOT have to be a <div> element and it does NOT have to have the id='root':
EXAMPLE:
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

ReactDOM.render(<p>Hallo</p>, document.getElementById('sandy'));
