REACT COMPONENTS:
==================
Components are like functions that return HTML elements.
=>Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.
=>Components come in two types
	=>Class components
	=>Function components.

CLASS COMPONENTS:
---------------------------------
=>A class component must include the extends React.Component statement. This statement creates an inheritance to React.Component, and gives your 
      component access to React.Component's functions.
EXAMPLE:
class Car extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
  }
}

FUNCTION COMPONENTS:
----------------------------------------
=>A Function component also returns HTML, and behaves much the same way as a Class component, but Function components can be written using much less code, 
     are easier to understand, and will be preferred in this tutorial.
EXAMPLE:
function Car() {
  return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
}

RENDERING COMPONENT:
-----------------------------------------

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

function Car() {
  return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Car />);

PROPERTIES:
-------------------
=>Components can be passed as props, which stands for properties.
=>Props are like function arguments, and you send them into the component as attributes.
EXAMPLE:
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

function Car(props) {
  return <h2>I am a { props.brand }!</h2>;
}

const myElement = <Car brand="Ford" />;

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(myElement);

1.PASS DATA:
-------------------

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

function Car(props) {
  return <h2>I am a { props.brand }!</h2>;
}

function Garage() {
  return (
    <>
	    <h1>Who lives in my garage?</h1>
	    <Car brand="Ford" />
    </>
  );
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Garage />);

COMPONENTS IN FILES:
-------------------------------------
=>React is all about re-using code, and it is recommended to split your components into separate files.
=>To do that, create a new file with a .js file extension and put the code inside it:
EXAMPLE:
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import Car from './Car.js';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Car />);
